# About Me

Hi, I'm Jordan - a Web3 Engineer primarily focused on building DeFi applications
in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm currently building [Ambos](https://ambos.finance), a simple, streamlined
and non-custodial application that helps people borrow fiat against their crypto without selling it.

Outside of tech, I enjoy working out, jamming out on my guitar, visiting new
places and finding as many uses for my slow cooker as possible.

The best way to reach me is via [email](mailto:j@jordaniza.com) or
[discord](https://discordapp.com/users/867719073885716501). I am always open to
new opportunities and discussions and am currently open for contracting.
