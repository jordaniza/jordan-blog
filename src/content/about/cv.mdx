# About Me

Hi, I'm Jordan - a Web3 Engineer from the UK primarily focused on building DeFi applications
in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm current helping onchain organizations build on top of [Aragon OSx](https://aragon.org/aragonosx).

Outside of tech, I enjoy working out, jamming out on my guitar, visiting new
places and finding as many uses for my slow cooker as possible.

The best way to reach me is via [email](mailto:j@jordaniza.com) or
[discord](https://discordapp.com/users/867719073885716501).
