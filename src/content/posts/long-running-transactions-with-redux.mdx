_This post was originally written a couple of years ago when I was building out an earlier version of Auxo. There have been some changes to the tools and libraries that are available now for solving some of the problems outlined in this article, but I think most of the concepts are still valid._


When we built Auxo, we wanted to integrate a number of the lessons learned from
building previous DApps and products in PieDAO. In any frontend web app, how you
manage the data (the state) is critical to keeping your app maintainable and
performant.

Recently, the tendency has been to move more and more of the application code
into the front end application, as operations on the blockchain are 💰
(expensive) and 🐢 (slow), compared to what we can do in the user’s browser with
a framework like React, Vue, Svelte or Angular.

At some point though, you _have_ to interact with the network. So, in order to
create a great user-experience for a DApp, we as developers need to have a very
clear conceptual framework for managing the kind of long-running transactions
that are typical in Web3. We also need to ensure we are giving plenty of user
feedback and are able to accurately reflect the state of the app, in relation to
the network, at a given time.

This post explains our approach in Auxo, in particular some of our early
discussions on what _doesn’t_ scale as an approach to managing transactions, and
how we can use the tools in the popular state management library _Redux_ to
create a clear separation between our components, blockchain transactions, and
user journeys.

# The Basics

A core feature of any DApp is the ability to submit transactions through the UI
and have them be resolved on chain.

The basic workflow of a transaction, using ethers JS and react:

1. Submit the transaction using the ethers Contract instance.
2. Wait for the promise to resolve, indicating the transaction was submitted
   successfully.
   1. During this stage, the user will probably be signing the transaction on
      Metamask, Trezor etc.
3. Wait for the network to confirm the transaction.

Part 1 is a simple UI interaction. Part 2 puts the application in an extended,
pending state, but importantly here, the user is engaged elsewhere (they are
signing the transaction).

Part 3 is more challenging. Network confirmations often take several seconds,
sometimes minutes, and sometimes lock for even longer. In the meantime, while
the user can see the transaction is pending in their wallet, our application
needs to know how to handle this intermediate state, and provide the relevant
user feedback.

Our approach at Auxo leverages Redux, Redux Toolkit (specifically slices and
‘Thunks’) and ethers to create a store capable of handling long-running
asynchronous transactions, while keeping the rest of the store, and the react UI
elements, synchronous.

# **Naive approach (In-component state updates)**

It’s helpful to remind ourselves one (super) simplified way how we might handle
submitting a transaction in the base case:

```tsx
const MAX_VALUE = // some big number (0xfff....fffff)
const TOKEN_ADDRESS = // erc20 token address
const SPENDER = // address of our spender (contract or EOA)

function MinimalTxComponent() {

    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
    const [approved, setApproved] = useState(false);

	const erc20 = useErc20Contract(TOKEN_ADDRESS);

    function approveErc20Max() {
	    setLoading(true);
	    if (erc20) erc20.approve(ethers.BigNumber.from(MAX_VALUE), SPENDER);
			else throw Error('No Erc20 Contract');
		})
        .then(() => setApproved(true))
        .catch(() => alert('Error'))
        .finally(() => setLoading(false))
    };

    return (
        <button
            onClick={approveErc20Max}
        >
            {loading ? 'Loading...' : approved ? 'Approved' : 'Click Me' }
        </button>
    )
}
```

The above component does nothing more than approves a large amount of tokens
from the sender to an address. This address could be a smart contract, or
another EOA.

<aside>
💡 A quick pointer on the `useErc20Contract` hook. For our purposes, assume that this returns an Ethers JS contract instance that is initialised with:

- A signer for the currently connected account
- The correct contract ABI

</aside>

This will work, but I could hardly consider it good practice. There are some
glaring issues, mostly related to extensibility and reusability of this
component:

- All our state and component logic is intertwined. With this simple example, it
  is not so bad, but as we continue to extend the component, add more complex
  error handling and state interactions, components quickly get messy and, I
  would argue, unmaintainable.
- Worse, I would argue, is that we are not properly handling long running
  transactions. To understand this, we need to examine the transaction workflow
  in javascript for ethers JS

# **The ethers transaction object**

Ethers transactions follow the below workflow:

<img src={TxFlow} alt="Basic Eth Transaction Flow" />

Specifically, we are creating a promise when we submit the transaction to the
network, awaiting _at least_ a succesful submission before the promise resolves.

**Key point: a submission is NOT a confirmation.**

The default behavior of ethers is to simply submit the transaction to the
network, resolve the promise and move on. At this stage, the transaction is
still in a pending state waiting to be picked up by a miner/validator and added
to the blockchain.

It’s possible to return the transaction at this first stage, giving a
[TransactionResponse](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers/types/#providers-TransactionResponse)
object, with some of the following properties set to `null` :

- BlockNumber
- BlockHash
- Timestamp

Crucially, we also have access to a `Transaction.wait` method. This will wait
for at least 1 network confirmation before resolving the promise, at which point
the above `BlockNumber`, `BlockHash` and `Timestamp` **will have actual
values.**

**Ok, how does this relate to our example?**

Awaiting a transaction confirmation can take several minutes in the worst case.
Along the way, there are all sorts of edge cases and error handling we might
want to consider.

Beyond the complexities of writing all this into a single component, the bigger
question is more: how do we update our application in multiple places, with
potentially multiple transactions?

# **A minimal Redux store**

<aside>
💡 I’m going to assume you understand the basics of React, Redux and state management from this point onwards.

</aside>

I’ve seen a lot of applications make heavy use of React hooks to manage state.
This is perfectly fine, but the hooks model is a very opinionated and
react-centric approach to developing web applications that has some
[notable teething problems](https://twitter.com/JordanImran2/status/1509793990505287699).

When we talk about complex state management in react apps, why reinvent the
wheel just because this is Web3?

Redux provides many out-the-box features and benefits that the hooks ecosystem
does not yet have standardised, and Redux Toolkit has been a pleasure to work
with, in my experience.

Before explaining HOW we use Redux, we need to understand what is in our store:

Our basic, multiple-vault state is pretty simple:

```tsx
interface VaultState {
  vaults: Vault[];
  selected: null | string;
}
```

We have a list of vaults, and a string indicator that allows us to indicate
which one of the vaults is currently `selected` :

<img src={Frax} alt="frax pool screenshot" />

The selected vault is useful when looking at the single vault page, and we
actually use the contract address of the deployed vault as the index.

## **What’s in a Vault?**

The basic vault in the state needs to contain, at the very least:

- The vault contract address
- Interfaces defined for our on-chain data (once we have it):

```tsx
interface Vault {
  address: string;
  token?: VaultToken; // address of the single deposit token
  auth?: VaultAuth; // whether the user is authorised to use the vault
  cap?: VaultCap; // per user deposit cap
  stats?: VaultStats; // total deposits across all users
  userBalances?: UserBalances; // deposits and other balances for current user
}
```

Details aren’t important, what you need to know is ‘Contract address is the
index, on chain data is added as we go’.

Once we’ve defined a couple of vaults, we can use Redux toolkit `createSlice` to
create the state:

```tsx
// vault.slice.ts

import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import { vaultState } from "./vault.state";

const vaultSlice = createSlice({
  name: "vault",
  initialState: vaultState, // vaultState is of type VaultState
});
```

<aside>
💡 `createSlice` is a way to instantiate a type-safe Redux store whilst avoiding a lot of boilerplate code.

# Dispatching an async action

The basic workflow we want to achieve is a decoupling of the component, the
synchronous state, and the asynchronous network calls.

_Assuming we are waiting for a transaction to be confirmed_, the flow should
look like this:

<img src={ReduxFlow} alt="Full Tx Flow" />

Here, the component dispatches the action to send the transaction to the
network. We now want two things to happen:

1. We want the component (and all other components) to be notified that the
   state is now ‘pending’ for that transaction.
2. We want the store to listen for updates in that transaction

# **Updating the state on Success with Redux Toolkit**

In Redux, we want our state reducers to always be synchronous, but we are now in
a position where our dispatch events trigger _highly_ asynchronous actions.
You’ve got a few options to solve this problem, such as:

- Redux Saga
- Redux Thunk
- RTK Query
- RTK createAsyncThunk

In Auxo, we used Redux Toolkit and the `createAsyncThunk` helper to achieve
this.

RTK Query was my first choice - Uniswap even have an
[RTK Query inspired multicall utility](https://github.com/Uniswap/redux-multicall)
(but I could not get it to work, unfortunately) - but in genery RTK Query
seemed, to me at least, more of a tool for RESTful API development. When it
comes to JSON-RPC requests routed through providers, I could not see an obvious
way to expose such calls into RTK Query APIs.

Sagas are popular, but they do introduce a lot of new concepts, including the
relatively esoteric javascript generator functions, which introduces a learning
curve.

In the end, we settled on `createAsyncThunk`. It seemed to walk a nice line
between relatively easy to understand, and having the async lifecycle
functionality we needed, it works like this:

<img src={ReduxSimple} alt="Redux Simple Flow" />

Thunks have a strange name, but are pretty easy to work with, all told. Let’s
say we want to approve a deposit for an ERC20:

- createAsyncThunk accepts several arguments, the first 3 are:
  - The name
  - The arguments passed to the thunk
  - A utilities object we might need

```tsx
createAsyncThunk(
  "vault/approveDeposit",
  async (
	// pass the deposit amount, and the token (ethers contract)
    { deposit, token }: ThunkApproveDepositProps,

	// we can destructure the utilities to fetch the state within our thunk
    { getState }
  ) => {
```

Simple enough. We need to select the correct vault from the list of vaults,
fortunately, we have a currently `selected` vault saved in our state (see
above), which makes this fairly trivial

```tsx
const { vault } = getState();
const tx = await token.approve(vault.selected, deposit);
```

Finally, we can wait for at least one network confirmation before resolving the
asynchronous action:

```tsx
const receipt = await tx.wait();

return receipt.status === 1 ? { deposit } : rejectWithValue("Approval Failed");
```

All together:

```tsx
import { createAsyncThunk } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import { Erc20 } from "../../types/artifacts/abi";

type ThunkApproveDepositProps = {
  deposit: string;
  token: Erc20 | undefined;
};

const thunkApproveDeposit = createAsyncThunk(
    "vault/approveDeposit",
    async ({ deposit, token }: ThunkApproveDepositProps, { getState, rejectWithValue }) => {
        const { vault } = getState();
        const tx = await token.approve(vault.selected, deposit);
        const receipt = await tx.wait();
        return receipt.status === 1 ? { deposit } : rejectWithValue("Approval Failed");
  },
);
```

## Adding Other Notifications

Notice we don’t need `try/catch` logic or anything like that. createAsyncThunk
exposes events if the promise resolves, rejects or is still pending, and we can
subscribe to those events to standardise our error handling - pretty neat!

These lifecycle events are accessed in the `extraReducers` section of our slice,
taking our approve action, it has 3 states:

- Pending
- Fulfilled
- Rejected

Assuming our above promise fulfills, we can update the state as follows:

```tsx
export const vaultSlice = createSlice({
    name: 'vault',
    initialState: vaultState,
	extraReducers: (builder) => {
    builder.addCase(thunkApproveDeposit.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
        // update the state here
    });
```

You can use exactly the same pattern for `.pending` and `.rejected` :

Let’s say I set up a global notification handler called `alert` . It takes 2
arguments:

- An alert message
- An alert type (affecting color or icons)

```tsx
builder.addCase(thunkApproveDeposit.pending, (state) => {
  state.alert = {
    message: "Approval Pending",
    type: "PENDING",
  };
});

builder.addCase(thunkApproveDeposit.rejected, (state, action) => {
  state.alert = {
    message: "Approval Failed",
    type: "ERROR",
  };
});
```

What I really like about this approach is that it entirely decouples the:

- Async logic
- Error handling
- Contract interaction
- In component behaviour

The above example is still somewhat minimal compared to the final state we used.
You can view the Auxo Github for more details, including how we:

- Separated the notifications into a separate application-wide slice, and
  created generic notification handlers.
- Implemented our vault transformations, for each of the different contract
  methods

# **Conclusion**

The fact that this article is this length, just to allow us to handle on-chain
transactions in what I would consider to be a scalable and manageable way, shows
that the DApp ecosystem still has a way to go in developing the abstractions and
SDKs that will facilitate rapid development and high quality user experiences in
the way Web2 has done so well.

At the same time, once you have a conceptual understanding of the way long
running transactions CAN work, it provides a lot of opportunities to think
through how to address the challenges. If I look at some of my favourite Web3
Frontends (Balancer jumps to mind), I’m really starting to be impressed by how
easy these tools are becoming to use, and I hope approaches like this can be
critiqued, re-worked, and improved on to build better applications.
