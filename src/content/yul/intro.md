This post is a series of lessons on learning assembly for smart contracts by hacking. We will be using OpenZeppelin's Ethernaut CTF to learn assembly.

## What is Assembly?

Assembly is a low-level programming language that is specific to a particular computer architecture. It is a human-readable representation of machine code. Assembly is used to write programs that are highly optimized for speed and size. Assembly is also used to write programs that interact with the operating system and hardware directly.

## Why Learn Assembly?

Learning assembly will help you understand how the EVM works. It will also help you understand how Solidity code is compiled to EVM bytecode. Learning assembly will also help you understand how to write more efficient Solidity code.

## Example

```solidity
function x() public pure {
  1;
}

```
