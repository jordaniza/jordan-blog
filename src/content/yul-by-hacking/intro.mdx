## Intro and...what are we doing here?

I beleive that there's a lot of merit in taking the long way round, and taking the time to learn technologies in depth is part of that.

No, it's not strictly neccessary to know Assembly to write smart contracts. But understanding assembly requires an complementary understanding of the EVM which is _definitely_ required to write smart contracts. On top of this it's a great refresher on a number of core computer science concepts.

Learning assembly for me has been part of a long, ongoing, journey to write better code and design better applications in an incredibly complex environment.

### Why hacking?

I've seen plenty of articles on assembly (such as [Jean Cvllr's excellent Medium series](https://jeancvllr.medium.com/solidity-tutorial-all-about-assembly-5acdfefde05c)) but I, personally, learn best with theory _and_ practice.

Hacking contracts is a great excuse to learn by _doing_. The Ethernaut challenges we are using give us a clear set of targets to aim for, and allow us to explore different assembly concepts bit-by-bit. Crucially, because we have a clear criteria for success, we can't get away with partial or false understandings.

Hacking forces us to think in an adversarial manner - a super important frame of mind to keep ourselves in while writing secure contracts.

Most importantly, solving the challenges is rewarding. You'll be able to look back and see a clear sense of progress as you complete each one.

## What this series covers

We're going to cover a lot of ground here. It's going to be bumpy ground at times.

By the end of this series you will understand:

- The differences between storage, memory and calldata
- Basic stack manipulation
- How to read and debug contract execution at the bytecode level
- Handling static vs dynamic data types
- Low level contract deployment
- Low level function calls
- How bytecode gets processed
- Different exploits uniquely enabled by using assembly

We're not going to cover every contract in Ethernaut because...it'll get boring and repetitive fast.

Instead, we're going to focus on a few select challenges that I believe will cover a decent spectrum of assembly concepts.

In the spirit of learning though, anon, I encourage you to complete at least a couple of these unfinished challenges entirely with the training wheels off. I'll leave a note at the end of each challenge with some suggested follow ups that might be good ways to test what's been covered so far.

## Some pre-reading

I'm writing this guide as a primer to assembly. But ultimately what I hope you takeaway from these posts is not the ability to shoehorn yul into every contract, nor show off what you know, instead it's a foundational and hands-on knowledge of how the EVM is processing your solidity code under the hood.

Saying all that, a lot of what we will be doing relies on you having a working knowledge of what the EVM is, and the basics of Memory, Storage, Calldata and the EVM Stack Machine.

So there's some pre-reading I want you to do.

You may already have seen the absolutely excellent series from [@noxx](https://twitter.com/noxx3xxon) on the EVM, if you have, and you've digested it _thoroughly_, feel free to carry on, if not _READ THESE ARTICLES_:

- [Chapter 1: EVM Basics](https://noxx.substack.com/p/evm-deep-dives-the-path-to-shadowy)
- [Chapter 2: Memory](https://noxx.substack.com/p/evm-deep-dives-the-path-to-shadowy-d6b)
- [Chapter 3: Storage and Slot Packing](https://noxx.substack.com/p/evm-deep-dives-the-path-to-shadowy-3ea)

And by read, I mean take your time: sit down - with a pen and paper if you have to - and go through this like you're back in school and studying alegbra.

This stuff is not hard but, if you are new to a lot of low-level computer science concepts, it will be confusing. Let me repeat: take your time. If it takes you a week or two to go through all of the posts properly - good. You will have a proper solid foundation that will make the rest of this much, much easier.

(And, for the record - this is [exactly what I did](https://github.com/jordaniza/Noxx-EVM-walkthroughs/tree/main/docs))

### Have Fun

All of this is a long-winded way of saying: don't put too much pressure on yourself - the best way to write good code is to write lots of bad code. Enjoy the process.

LFG.
