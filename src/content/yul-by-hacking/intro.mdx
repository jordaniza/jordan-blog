- Why Do this

## How to get the most out of this series

### Try not to jump to solutions

It's tempting to reach for solutions sooner rather than later, especially when following tutorials and when the answer is right there. I'd suggest you don't do that. As with the pre-reading section below, give yourself time to learn things, and take a break if you don't get it straight away.

Each article aims to eventually lead you to a solution, but at some stage I would prefer if you stopped, and finished the rest of the solution without me. To that end, we will be introducing relevant concepts and teasing answers, rather than providing a full solution, where possible. You can of course check the solutions on my [Github](https://github.com/jordaniza/assemblynaut/tree/main/test).

### Do some pre-reading

I'm writing this guide as a primer to assembly. But ultimately what I hope you takeaway from these posts is not the ability to shoehorn yul into every contract, nor show off what you know, instead it's a foundational and hands-on knowledge of how the EVM is processing your solidity code under the hood.

Saying all that, a lot of what we will be doing relies on you having a working knowledge of what the EVM is, and the basics of Memory, Storage, Calldata and the EVM Stack Machine.

So there's some pre-reading I want you to do.

You may already have seen the absolutely excellent series from [@noxx](https://twitter.com/noxx3xxon) on the EVM, if you have, and you've digested it _thoroughly_, feel free to carry on, if not _READ THESE ARTICLES_:

- [Chapter 1: EVM Basics](https://noxx.substack.com/p/evm-deep-dives-the-path-to-shadowy)
- [Chapter 2: Memory](https://noxx.substack.com/p/evm-deep-dives-the-path-to-shadowy-d6b)
- [Chapter 3: Storage and Slot Packing](https://noxx.substack.com/p/evm-deep-dives-the-path-to-shadowy-3ea)

And by read, I mean take your time. I mean sit down - with a pen and paper if you have to - and go through this like you're back in school and studying alegbra.

This stuff is not hard but, if you are new to a lot of low-level computer science concepts, it will be confusing. Let me repeat: take your time. If it takes you a week or two to go through all of the posts properly - good. You will have a proper solid foundation that will make the rest of this much, much easier.

(And, for the record - this is [exactly what I did](https://github.com/jordaniza/Noxx-EVM-walkthroughs/tree/main/docs))

### Have Fun

All of this is a long-winded way of saying: don't put too much pressure on yourself.

The best way to write good code is to write lots of bad code. Enjoy the process.
