## Some pre-reading

Ultimately what I hope you takeaway from these posts is not the ability to shoehorn yul into every contract, nor show off what you know, instead it's a foundational and hands-on knowledge of how the EVM is processing your solidity code under the hood.

Saying all that, a lot of what we will be doing relies on you having at least a basic knowledge of what the EVM is, and the basics of Memory, Storage, Calldata and the EVM Stack Machine. I will try my best to cover things as they come up, but I suggest that you prepare yourself with some learning.

In the appendix section of [this series]('/learn-assembly-by-hacking) you'll see a basic primer on reading from memory and setting up a dev environment, but there's a couple of posts I wanted to share with you as well.

### EVM Deep Dives

You may already have seen the absolutely excellent series from [@noxx](https://twitter.com/noxx3xxon) on the EVM, if you have, and you've digested it _thoroughly_, feel free to carry on, if not _READ THESE ARTICLES_:

- [Chapter 1: EVM Basics](https://noxx.substack.com/p/evm-deep-dives-the-path-to-shadowy)
- [Chapter 2: Memory](https://noxx.substack.com/p/evm-deep-dives-the-path-to-shadowy-d6b)
- [Chapter 3: Storage and Slot Packing](https://noxx.substack.com/p/evm-deep-dives-the-path-to-shadowy-3ea)

And by read, I mean take your time: sit down - with a pen and paper if you have to - and go through this like you're back in school and studying alegbra.

This stuff is not hard but, if you are new to a lot of low-level computer science concepts, it will be confusing.

Let me repeat: take your time. If it takes you a week or two to go through all of the posts properly - good. You will have a proper solid foundation that will make the rest of this much, much easier.

(For the record - this is [exactly what I did](https://github.com/jordaniza/Noxx-EVM-walkthroughs/tree/main/docs))

When you're ready, let's get started.
