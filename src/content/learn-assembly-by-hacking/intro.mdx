## Intro and...what are we doing here?

Hi Anon,

If you're reading this then you're probably spending your free time looking at something that is most people's idea of total boredom. You're someone who is probably interested in _learning for learning's sake_, and I commend you for that.

I've been a writing code for not too far off a decade now, and being curious about new things has been a constant companion. I believe it's worth taking the time to learn the tools we use in depth, not just to

No, it's not strictly neccessary to know Assembly to write smart contracts. But being able to write assembly _that works_ requires that we have a really solid foundation on how _the EVM works_ - something which is _definitely_ required to write smart contracts.

### Why hacking?

Great question.

First, it sounds cool ðŸ˜Ž

Second, it's a way we can learn by _doing_.

I've seen some really excellent articles on assembly (such as from [Jean Cvllr](https://jeancvllr.medium.com/solidity-tutorial-all-about-assembly-5acdfefde05c) or [Noxx](https://noxx.substack.com/p/evm-deep-dives-the-path-to-shadowy)) but I, personally, learn best with theory _and_ practice.

We're going to be working with actual contracts with a clear criteria to aim for with each hack, which will allow us to explore different assembly concepts bit-by-bit.

Along the way, by being hands-on, we will be confronting that embarrassing feeling of realising that, maybe we didn't understand some of those articles _quite_ as well as we thought.

And that's okay. We will go back, revist and apply our knowledge, and we will come out with a _much_ stronger understanding of what we're doing versus having not put what we learned into practice.

Thirdly, hacking forces us to think in an adversarial manner - a super important frame of mind to keep ourselves in while writing secure contracts.

Finally, and most importantly, solving the challenges is fun. It's rewarding.

I like doing fun and rewarding things. I hope you do to.
