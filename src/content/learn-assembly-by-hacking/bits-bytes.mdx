## Topics Covered

- Hex, decimal and binary representation
- A refresher on reading different hex strings

We're going to be reading a lot of raw bytecode data, so it's important to recall some of the basics around low-level data representations. In particular some of the differences between representations in different base formats, and how that looks in our editor.

## Opcodes

All data in the EVM is ultimately expressed as machine code, which is typically represented as hexadecimal bytecode, prefixed with `0x`.

We use the term "Opcode" to refer to a single instruction executed on the EVM. You can see a list of these at [EVM Codes](https://www.evm.codes/).

An opcode is a single byte value from `0x00` -> `0xff`, corresponding to an instruction in the EVM.

Opodes are executed like functions. They take arguments and push values onto the stack. There's a lot of great primers on the stack in the EVM which I wont repeat here. What we need to know is that 1 byte -> 1 opcode.

## Base notation

Most of the time we are looking at EVM code, we are looking at hexadecimal, you can do a quick conversion using foundry's `chisel` CLI:

```sh
$ chisel
Welcome to Chisel! Type `!help` to show available commands.
➜ 123
Type: uint
├ Hex: 0x7b
└ Decimal: 123
➜ 0x123
Type: uint
├ Hex: 0x123
└ Decimal: 291
➜
```

Equally, hex or decimal can be represented as binary. Solidity doesn't have a very easy way to represent values in binary, but in python we can use the native `bin` function, which will prefix binary values with `0b`:

```python
>>> bin(0xff)
'0b11111111'
```

So, as an example:

| Decimal | Hexadecimal | Binary       |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 1       | `0x01`      | `0b1`        |
| 2       | `0x02`      | `0b10`       |
| 10      | `0x0a`      | `0b1010`     |
| 32      | `0x20`      | `0b100000`   |
| 255     | `0xff`      | `0b11111111` |

Note that `0x01` is, strictly speaking, the same as `0x1`. However we often think about bytecode (clue is in the name) in terms of 8 bit / 1 byte values, therefore `0x01` more explicit than `0x1`. More importantly, `0x1` can sometimes be incorrectly loaded as `0x10` if you're not careful, which will definitely cause issues.

It's important to bear in mind when reading logs like the below:

Say we're looking at the value `80` at the end of line `02` in the above image. This is `0x80`, or 128 in decimal, not 80, which would be `0x50`.

## Hex Characters versus Length

Armed with the above knowledge, we can tackle something that I personally found extremely confusing when I first was trying to understand the EVM.

Take the humble Ethereum Address:

`0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045`

How _long_ is the above address?

- 160 bits (each address can be represented as a `uint160`)
- 20 bytes (8 bits in a byte => 160/8)
- 40 hexadecimal characters (1 byte = 2 characters)

The 40 characters can trip you up occassionally, for example:

```solidity
    bytes solverBytecode = hex"69602a601f5360206000f3600052600a6016f369602a601f5360206000f3600052600a6016f3";

    function testByteCodeLen() public {
      uint len;
      assembly {
        len := sload(solverBytecode.slot)
      }
      console2.log("ASM Length:", len);
      console2.log("Solidity Length:", solverBytecode.length);
    }
```

`forge test --match test testByteCodeLen` gives the logs:

```sh
[PASS] testByteCodeLen() (gas: 6434)
Logs:
  ASM Length: 77
  Solidity Length: 38
```

What's going on here?

The length of the aray data is stored in terms of _hex characters_ (starting at length 1), which we can see via loading directly from assembly.

Conversely, solidity recognises that the variable `solverBytecode` is of type `bytes`, and correctly returns that the length, in bytes, is (76 hex characters / 2) 38 bytes in length.
