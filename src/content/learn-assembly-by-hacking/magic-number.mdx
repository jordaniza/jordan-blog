The first challenge we are going to take on is less of an exploit and more of a review of a number of super important foundations when dealing with assembly. We're going to cover a decent chunk of ground here but by the end, we should have a good grasp of what actually happens _at the bytecode level_ when we send a call to a contract.

## Topics Covered

- Reading Bytecode instructions
- Writing our first lines of assembly

## The challenge:

> To solve this level, you only need to provide the Ethernaut with a Solver, a contract that responds to `whatIsTheMeaningOfLife()` with the right number...
> ...The solver's code needs to be really tiny. Really reaaaaaallly tiny. Like freakin' really really itty-bitty tiny: 10 opcodes at most.

Sounds interesting. What does the contract look like?

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MagicNum {
    address public solver;
    constructor() {}
    function setSolver(address _solver) public {
        solver = _solver;
    }
}
```

Simple enough. Let's setup our test:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "../src/MagicNum.sol";

contract ASMMagicNum is Test {
    MagicNum public target;
    function setUp() public {
        target = new MagicNum();
    }

    function testAttackMagicNum() public {
        // fetch the solver from the MagicNum contract
        address solver = target.solver();
        // ensure that the code length is 10 bytes
        assertLe(solver.code.length, 10);
        // call solver with "whatIsTheMeaningOfLife()"
        (, bytes memory data) = solver.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("whatIsTheMeaningOfLife()"));
        // decode the data and check it's correct
        uint256 decoded = abi.decode(data, (uint256));
        assertEq(decoded, 42);
    }
}
```

Our test is pretty simple. We setup the contract, then grab the solver from the contract and validate that the code length is, in fact, less than or equal to 10 bytes. Finally we call the address stored there with `whatIsTheMeaningOfLife()`. Finally, we check the data is equal to 42.

## Below 10 bytes

If we try and solve this in solidity, the solution might look like:

```solidity
contract Solver {
  function whatIsTheMeaningOfLife() external pure returns (uint) {
    return 42;
  }
}

contract ASMMagicNum is Test {
   // ...
    function testAttackMagicNum() public {
        target.setSolver(address(new Solver()));
        address solver = target.solver();
        // ...
    }
}
```

However, this will predictably fail:

```sh
[FAIL. Reason: Assertion failed.] testAttackMagicNum() (gas: 100157)
Logs:
  Error: a <= b not satisfied [uint]
    Value a: 119
    Value b: 10
```

Getting `solver` to 10 bytes is one thing, but a valid question we might want to ask is: how do we even deploy bytecode to an address?

One option for us is to use one of foundry's inbuilt cheat codes so we can start working on the solution.

(Don't worry - by the end of this article we will do things the "proper" way)

### Cheating a bit

`vm.etch` is a nifty little cheatcode that allows us to write arbitrary data to an address. This will allow us to write a raw bytecode solution without having to run through contract creation (yet). It takes 2 arguments:

- The address to write to
- The hexadecimal data to write

We can add it to our test in 2 lines, first we define a variable `solverBytecode`:

```solidity
contract ASMMagicNum is Test {
    MagicNum public target;

    // here we can put whatever code we want, the ffffff is just random data
    bytes solverBytecode = hex"ffffff";
```

And let's use the cheatcode in our test

```solidity
    function testAttackMagicNum() public {
        address solver = target.solver();

        vm.etch(solver, solverBytecode);

        // ensure that the code length is 10 bytes
        assertLe(solver.code.length, 10);
```

Running our test command gives the new log:

```sh
[FAIL. Reason: EvmError: Revert] testAttackMagicNum() (gas: 9079256848778899555)

```

Whoa there...`StackUnderflow`, sounds scary. But at least we've made it past the `code.length` check? Let's breakdown what's actually going on here.

(You might see `650500c1()` in place of `whatIsTheMeaningOfLife()`, we will touch on all this in another post).

### Runtime

When we call `solver`, the EVM does nothing more than **execute the code that exists at that address, with the calldata passed to it**.

In our case, the following steps happen:

- We haven't set a solver, so solver returns the zero address
- We have stored the bytecode `0xffffff` at the zero address using `vm.etch`
- `address(0x0)` is called with the signature `"whatIsTheMeaningOfLife()"` and no additional calldata.

Usually, when we call a contract in solidity, the compiled contract will check that the function `whatIsTheMeaningOfLife()` exists, and revert if it does not. This is typically achieved using a jumptable embedded into the contract bytecode (`JUMP`, `JUMPI` and `JUMPDEST` being the relevant opcodes you will see in most contracts).

In our case, we don't have any of that. Instead we have `0xffffff`, which can be written as 3 bytes of the opcode `0xFF`/[SELFDESTRUCT](https://www.evm.codes/#ff?fork=shanghai)

We can check this by stepping into the debugger:

```sh
forge test --debug testAttackMagicNum
```

This will walk you line by line through the contract execution, keep moving until you get to the following spot.

(This is the state of the EVM as right before we call our `solver` contract. Don't worry if none of this makes sense just yet.)

![magic-call](/ybh/magic/call.png)

Advancing one more step, and this is what it looks like when we are calling our `solver` contract. Notice that we have an empty stack, nothing in memory, but that we are at the zero address:

![magic-call](/ybh/magic/selfdestruct.png)

If we check the OPCODE info for [SELFDESTRUCT](https://www.evm.codes/#ff?fork=shanghai) we can see that it takes 1 argument - **Stack input**:

> address: account to send the current balance to (see BALANCE or SELFBALANCE since Istanbul fork).

So the first SELFDESTRUCT call is trying to operate on an empty stack - impossible and hence the `StackUnderflow` error we mentioned above.

All well and good, but also kinda useless. Let's actually write some useful code.

## An actual solution

What we want to do is actually really simple:

When the address stored in `target.solver` is called, return the number 42.

Let go back to our friend EVM Codes, this time for the [RETURN OPCODE](https://www.evm.codes/#f3?fork=shanghai)

Straight away we can see that `RETURN` expects 2 arguments from the stack:

> 1. offset: byte offset in the memory in bytes, to copy what will be the return data of this context.
> 2. size: byte size to copy (size of the return data).

### Offset

Recall how memory is stored in the EVM: it's a giant array that is wiped between contract calls. We can store whatever data we want in there, and we can fetch it by pointing to _the location in memory from where we want to fetch._

"the location in memory from where we want to fetch" is also known as the `offset` above.

Examples (spaces added for readability):

```sh
# Offset 0x00
0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
^
# Offset 0x04
0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
          ^
```

(Remember that the offset in our case is in bytes, which are represented by 2 hex characters.)

### Size

Size is very simple: starting from the offset, it just represents how many bytes to return, so if your data at offset 0x02 is `DEADC0FFEE00000000000...`, size of `0x02` will return `0xDEAD`, while size of `0x05` will return `0xDEADC0FFEE`.

### Putting it together

The EVM is a stack machine, so the OPCODE `RETURN` will take its arguments sequentially, from the top of the stack. Meaning we need the stack to look like:

```sh
0 | OFFSET
1 | SIZE
```

We will therefore need to make sure that, at the offset, the number `42` / `0x2a` is stored in Memory at the offset that we choose.

## Storing in Memory

Memory has 2 opcodes for storage [MSTORE](https://www.evm.codes/#52?fork=shanghai) and [MSTORE8](https://www.evm.codes/#53?fork=shanghai).

Both take 2 arguments, an offset (which we discussed above) that says where in memory to **store** the data, and a `value` argument.

For `MSTORE` the value will be left padded and stored as a full 256 bit word, for `MSTORE8` the value is stored as an 8 bit value.

When we return the value, the data will be read as a full word, so we need to return:

```sh
0000 0000 0000 0000
0000 0000 0000 0000
0000 0000 0000 0000
0000 0000 0000 002a
```

You might notice that there are 2 ways to do this:

1. MSTORE the value `0x2a` starting at offset zero
2. MSTORE8 the value `0x2a` starting at offset `0x1f` (31 bytes)

[Here's a link to the EVM Playground to demonstrate](https://www.evm.codes/playground?fork=shanghai&unit=Wei&codeType=Mnemonic&code='ytzwzzy8tx1fsvNOT%20OKAY'%3Aux00sz'~zPUSH1%200z%5CnyvWITH%20wwMSTOREv%2F%2Ft~x2a~t%20uszw8zz%01stuvwyz~_)

Doesn't matter enormously which one you prefer for this exercise.

## Bytecode Solution

Let's write our bytecode.

`60` is the opcode for [PUSH1](https://www.evm.codes/#60?fork=shanghai). It takes the next opcode and...pushes it to the stack.

We start with the above: we store `0x2a` as the last byte in a 32 byte word, at the zero offset in memory:

```sh
60 2a                   // PUSH1 VALUE (0x2a = 42)
60 1f                   // PUSH1 MEMORY OFFSET (31 bytes)
53                      // MSTORE8 (offset, value)
```

Then, we need to return it with opcode `f3` as above.

```sh
60 20                   // PUSH1: RETURN DATA SIZE (32 bytes)
60 00                   // PUSH1: MEMORY OFFSET (0 bytes)
f3                      // RETURN (offset, size)
```

Hopefully, after the above, that's not too scary.

Put together we have the full bytecode `602a601f5360206000f3` - a perfect 10 bytes!

Let's give this a whirl and see what happens!

```solidity
contract ASMMagicNum is Test {
    MagicNum public target;

    bytes solverBytecode = hex"602a601f5360206000f3";

    // ... rest of the contract
}
```

Run it with full logging to see the stack trace:

```sh
forge test --mt testAttackMagicNum -vvvvv
```

```sh

```

Test passed! That's great news!

If you want to see the contract step-by-step, call `forge test --debug testAttackMagicNum` to see the stack, memory and contract in action.

Interestingly enough, we can see in the logs that the function `whatIsTheMeaningOfLife()` was called and returns `42` / `0x2a` even though we didn't specify any functions in our bytecode. As mentioned earlier - normally solidity will compile our bytecode with JUMP logic for different defined functions (more on these in other sections) and REVERT if nothing was found. In our case **no matter what we call the function will return 42**. Try it for yourself.

Let's take a break for a minute - we still need to remove the forge cheatcode `vm.etch`, but this post is getting long enough. Grab a coffee, take a walk, go touch some grass. See you in the next one.
