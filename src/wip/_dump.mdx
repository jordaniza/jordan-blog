So we can see that the address is in there, and crucially the rest of the 32 byte word is padded with extra zeroes.

This is a pretty crucial concept that we will need to remember when working with data in the EVM:

- Decoding data in the right way is _essential_ when working with EVM data.

Let's add a couple of steps to our logging, converting from a bytes32 value -> 32 byte/256 bit unsigned integer (uint256) -> 160 bit unsigned integer -> ethereum address (which is itself 160 bits):

```solidity
function testFetchAddress() public view {
  bytes32 fetchedAddress;
  assembly {
    fetchedAddress := sload(target.slot)
  }
  console2.log("Fetched from assembly");
  console2.logBytes32(fetchedAddress);

  console2.log("Converted to 256 bit uint");
  console2.log(uint(fetchedAddress));

  console2.log("Converted to 160 bit uint");
  console2.log(uint160(uint(fetchedAddress)));

  console2.log("Converted to address");
  console2.log(address(uint160(uint(fetchedAddress))));

  console2.log("Fetched from solidity");
  console2.log(address(target));
}
```

aaaand the output:

```
Fetched from assembly
0x0000000000000000000000005615deb798bb3e4dfa0139dfa1b3d433cc23b72f
Converted to 256 bit uint
491460923342184218035706888008750043977755113263
Converted to 160 bit uint
491460923342184218035706888008750043977755113263
Converted to address
0x5615dEB798BB3E4dFa0139dFa1b3D433Cc23b72f
Fetched from solidity
0x5615dEB798BB3E4dFa0139dFa1b3D433Cc23b72f
```

### The function signature

Define the function signature as 4 bytes (8 characters of hex) of the keccak256 hash of the function name, for example:

```js
// example function
function doStuff(address _to) public { /* */ }

// the function signature
"doStuff(address)"

// keccak256 hash of the function signature
"373cf23c710cb05bc335f291b632bd5850910a740614e32783c487b47f38ddc3"

// the first 4 bytes
"373cf23c"
```

If we were to look at the function loaded into a word on the calldata, we would get:

```
0x373cf23c0000000000000000000000008e851e94e1667Cd76Dda1A49f258934E2BCDCF3e
  --------                        ----------------------------------------
  signature                                        argument
```

Recall that, in solidity, we can make a low-level contract call in the following way:

```solidity
bytes memory data = abi.encodeWithSignature("doStuff(uint256)", (someNumber));

address(Contract).call({value: _value})(data);
```

In Yul, things are slightly different. Let's look at the super useful [EVM Codes](https://www.evm.codes/#f1?fork=homestead)

There's a lot there, but let's jump to just the parameters:

> Stack input
> gas: amount of gas to send to the sub context to execute. The gas that is not used by the sub context is returned to this one.
> address: the account which context to execute.
> value: value in wei to send to the account.
> argsOffset: byte offset in the memory in bytes, the calldata of the sub context.
> argsSize: byte size to copy (size of the calldata).
> retOffset: byte offset in the memory in bytes, where to store the return data of the sub context.
> retSize: byte size to copy (size of the return data).

### Answer

1. Call contribute with 1 wei to pass the require check in the fallbak.
2. Call fallback with 1 wei to become the owner
3. Call withdraw to extrac the balance of the contract.
