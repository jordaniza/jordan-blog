# Jordaniza's Blog

- This is a work-in-progress series that I've hosted on my new [Astro](https://astro.build/) blog, where I take you through writing EVM Assembly code (Yul & Bytecode) in a hands-on way.
- In it we complete challenges in the [OpenZeppelin Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com) using pure assembly, something [I have been doing myself](https://github.com/jordaniza/assemblynaut)

## Getting started

This site uses `pnpm`, commands work similarly to npm, but faster.

To get started, `git clone` the repo, run `pnpm i`, then `pnpm run dev` to serve on port 3000.

Hot reloads are enabled by default, and the current set of posts are pages in `content` folder.
